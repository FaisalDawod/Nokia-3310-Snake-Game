# Nokia 3310 SnakeGame

### _About the application_:
> Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.

#### As a tribute to the nostalgia and global popularity of the classic snake game on Nokia phones, I created a prototype version of the game using a JavaScript file. The game features a square-shaped apple and a group of connected cubes representing the snake, which grows longer as it consumes the apple. The apple's location is randomized for added challenge. While the game requires further development in terms of certain missions and aesthetics, it serves as a starting point for a potential revamped version of the beloved classic.
