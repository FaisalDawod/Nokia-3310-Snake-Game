# Nokia 3310 Snake Game

### Overview:
The Nokia 3310 Snake Game is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers a growing line, often themed as a snake, and must keep it from colliding with obstacles and itself.

### About the application:
This prototype version of the classic snake game is a tribute to its global popularity and nostalgia, particularly on Nokia phones. The game is developed using a JavaScript file and features a square-shaped apple and a group of connected cubes representing the snake. As the snake consumes the apple, it grows longer, and the apple's location is randomized for an added challenge.

### Future Development:
While the game requires further development in terms of certain missions and aesthetics, it serves as an excellent starting point for a potential revamped version of the beloved classic.
